# extract-netsuite-json-database
Extract Netsuite data with the JSON exported from PHP-API

My company use Netsuite, then we want to discontinue using Netsuite.
1. We extract all transactions, information such as customers and vendors into json
2. We create this App to build sql script that can do import/replace/update to the current data of our App.

Cheers.
